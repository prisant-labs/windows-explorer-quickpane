# Changelog

## [3.10.0.10] - 2026-10-30

### Fixed
- Dragging the border of an Explorer window that has the pane no longer makes the window flicker. Explorer puts its content back at full width on every step of a drag, and the pane moved it back each time, so Explorer's own navigation tree and the file list jumped under the pane and back about a hundred times in a two-second drag. The pane now leaves the window to Explorer until the mouse button is released, and then restores the layout once. During the drag, Explorer's navigation tree sits under the pane, and it returns beside the pane on release ([#99](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/99)).

## [3.10.0.9] - 2026-10-29

These fixes come from an independent review of 3.10.0.8.

### Fixed
- After a profile switch, an edit made before the new profile's groups finished loading was written into the previous profile's folder, and reordering groups could move the previous profile's group folders into the new one. The pane now drops the old groups at once, discards a scan that finished for the old folder, and refuses an edit on a group, tab, or pin outside the current groups folder. This was a regression in 3.10.0.8 ([#68](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/68)).
- A pane section closed while a rebuild was waiting could subscribe itself again, so it stayed in memory and kept rebuilding for the rest of the session. Closing a section is now final, and a closed pane ignores rebuilds that were already queued ([#69](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/69)).
- With several Windows 11 tabs, the tab in front was read before the list of Explorer windows, so a tab switch during a slow listing could send a click to the previous tab. The tab in front is now read again after the list ([#72](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/72)).

### Changed
- Loading settings at startup no longer creates the groups folder on the UI thread. A groups folder on a share that does not answer no longer holds up startup; the background scan creates the folder ([#70](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/70)).
- A pin click in an Open or Save dialog's pane goes to the navigation thread first. Recording the app for Recent Apps now happens afterwards in the background, and writes to `recentapps.txt` take turns ([#71](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/71)).
- The shared window event hook reports in the log when a hook cannot be removed, or is removed from the wrong thread ([#73](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/73)).
- `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` records that the Recent check can miss a short visit to a folder with the same name as the one before ([#74](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/74)).

## [3.10.0.8] - 2026-10-29

### Fixed
- A folder click in the pane could wait for unrelated background work to finish first, such as the Recent check, a probe of an offline network path, or a large drag-and-drop copy. Folder clicks in Explorer windows, file dialogs, and the desktop dock now run on a thread of their own, so a click waits only for an earlier click ([#38](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/38)).
- Clicking Browse in Edit path, or opening any folder picker, froze the pane and Explorer for the network timeout, twice, when the starting folder was on a share that did not answer. A disconnected mapped drive timed out once for every level of the path. Each check now gives up after a second, and the picker opens without a starting folder ([#41](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/41)).

### Changed
- In an Explorer window with only one tab, a folder click and the Recent check stop at the first matching shell window instead of reading the list of every open tab on the desktop ([#40](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/40)).
- The Recent section's 2-second check of the Explorer window in front no longer queries every open Explorer window each time. It first compares the window's title and front tab with the last check, and runs the full query only when one of them changed, or every 30 seconds otherwise ([#39](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/39)).
- QuickPane reads the groups folder in the background at startup and when the groups folder setting changes. A groups folder on a slow or unreachable network share no longer holds up startup and the tray icon. Pins appear a moment after the pane does ([#42](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/42)).
- The log keeps its files open for the session instead of opening and closing a file for every line. Each line is still written to disk at once, the files can still be opened in an editor while QuickPane runs, and a log file deleted while open is created again ([#46](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/46)).
- When the shared icon cache is full, it drops only the icons used longest ago, instead of emptying completely and making every visible row load its icon again ([#47](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/47)).
- The record of which paths exist, used to dim offline pins, now holds at most 4,096 paths and forgets the ones used longest ago. It used to keep every path ever shown for as long as QuickPane ran ([#48](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/48)).
- The groups folder is rescanned only for changes that can alter the groups: a folder or shortcut added, removed, or renamed, or a shortcut edited in place. Write-time changes on folders and on files such as `desktop.ini` no longer each set off a rescan of every pin ([#49](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/49)).
- The crash guard's heartbeat file is rewritten when QuickPane's recorded activity changes, or once a minute when idle, instead of every 4 seconds all day ([#50](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/50)).
- Each layout pass on an Explorer window walks its tabs once instead of two or three times ([#45](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/45)).
- The once-a-second check for new Explorer windows asks Windows for Explorer windows directly, instead of reading the class name of every window on the desktop ([#44](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/44)).
- QuickPane installs each system-wide window event hook once and shares it among the parts that need it. Window moves and resizes anywhere on the desktop used to reach QuickPane twice, and focus changes three times ([#43](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/43)).

## [3.10.0.7] - 2026-10-29

Never published as a release. Its fix first shipped in 3.10.0.8.

### Fixed
- In a Windows 11 Explorer window with more than one tab, clicking a folder in the pane opened it in the first tab instead of the tab on screen, and the Recent section recorded the first tab's folder instead of the one being viewed. Both now follow the tab in front ([#35](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/35)).

## [3.10.0.6] - 2026-10-28

### Changed
- The settings gear now sits at the bottom left of the pane, under the QuickPane icon, instead of the bottom right. It stays in the same place when the pane collapses ([#33](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/33)).

### Fixed
- In the collapsed pane, the expand arrow sat to the right of the strip's centre. It now centres in the strip ([#33](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/33)).

## [3.10.0.5] - 2026-10-28

Never published as a release. Its changes first shipped in 3.10.0.6.

### Changed
- On Windows 11 the pane and Settings draw their icons with Segoe Fluent Icons, the shell's current icon set. Windows 10 keeps Segoe MDL2 Assets ([#24](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/24)).
- The settings gear stays at the bottom of the pane when the pane is collapsed to its narrow strip, so Settings opens in one click without expanding the pane first ([#22](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/22)).

### Fixed
- With a Windows contrast theme on, the pane and Settings kept their own light or dark colors. They now take the contrast theme's colors, and switch back when it is turned off, with no restart ([#30](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/30)).
- Screen readers and other accessibility tools could not see any control inside a Settings tab, and several buttons had no name, or only a symbol such as "+" or "✕" for one. Every Settings control is now reachable, and icon and symbol buttons, steppers, text boxes, and the section check boxes carry names that say what they do, such as "Delete group Work" or "Increase recents count" ([#28](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/28)).
- In dark mode, the Settings window had a white title bar over its dark content. The title bar now follows the Windows light or dark mode, including a switch made while Settings is open ([#26](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/26)).
- The pane always used the default blue instead of the Windows accent color, because it read the accent from a registry key that does not hold it. The active tab, the drag drop line, and the accent-colored Settings controls now follow the accent chosen in Windows, including changes made while QuickPane runs ([#20](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/20)).

## [3.10.0.4] - 2026-10-27

Never published as a release. Its changes first shipped in 3.10.0.6.

### Changed
- Add/Remove Programs names the app "QuickPane 3.10.0.4" instead of "QuickPane version 3.10.0.4" ([#18](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/18)).

### Removed
- The "Buy me a coffee" button, both at the bottom of the pane and in the Settings footer. It opened the original author's donation page, which does not fund this fork ([#18](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/18)).

## [3.10.0.3] - 2026-10-27

### Added
- Each release includes an installer, `QuickPane-<version>-x64-setup.exe`, built by the release workflow and covered by its checksums and attestation. Run over an existing QuickPane, including one from the original project's installer, it upgrades that install in place, so Add/Remove Programs keeps one entry and shows the new version.
- The installer puts `LICENSE.txt` beside the program.

### Changed
- Add/Remove Programs lists Prisant Labs as the publisher, and its links go to this fork.
- The installer reads its version from the built program, so a release no longer needs `Installer.iss` edited.

## [3.10.0.2] - 2026-10-27

This release includes every change listed under 3.10.0.1 in [CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md), plus the fixes below.

### Added
- Releases are built by a GitHub Actions workflow when a version tag is pushed, from exactly the tagged commit on `main`. Each release ships a zip, `SHA256SUMS.txt`, and a build provenance attestation that `gh attestation verify` checks.
- The release zip includes `LICENSE`.

### Fixed
- In a Windows 11 Explorer window with more than one tab, only one tab made room for the pane. Every other tab stayed at full width, so either the pane covered Explorer's navigation pane or the tab covered the pane. Every tab now makes room, including tabs opened later, and the layout keeps working after the first tab is closed ([#4](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/4), [lso2/QuickPane#3](https://github.com/lso2/QuickPane/issues/3)).
- The pane showed its profile row even with only one profile, as a lone "Profile 1" chip that switched nothing. The row now appears once a second profile exists ([#5](https://github.com/prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane/issues/5)).

## [3.10.0.1] - 2026-10-21

Never published as a release. Its changes first shipped in 3.10.0.2, the first published release of the prisant-labs/windows-explorer-quickpane fork. Both build on upstream 3.10.0. Fork releases add a fourth version number to the upstream version they build on.

### Added
- A "File dialogs" setting on the Pane tab, so the pane in Open and Save dialogs can follow Explorer windows, sit beside the dialog, or stay off.
- A "Browse..." button in the "Edit path" prompt, which opens a folder or file picker at the pin's current target.
- A unit-test project in `tests/QuickPane.Tests`, run with `scripts/test.ps1`.
- Build and test scripts in `scripts/` that work with or without the .NET Framework 4.8 targeting pack installed.
- A GitHub Actions workflow that builds the app and runs the tests on every push and pull request.

### Changed
- "Add folder..." and the groups-folder "..." button open the modern Explorer-style folder picker instead of the legacy "Browse For Folder" tree ([lso2/QuickPane#2](https://github.com/lso2/QuickPane/issues/2)).
- The update notice in the Settings footer checks this fork's releases instead of upstream's, so it never offers an upstream installer that would replace the fork's fixes. Until the fork has a published release, the footer reads "Up to date" instead of "Update check failed".
- The update notice shows a fork release's full four-part version, such as 3.10.0.2, instead of dropping the fourth part.

### Fixed
- A group with more than one tab had no way to add a folder or file from a tab's menu. The tab menu now has "Add folder..." and "Add file...", and the pin lands in that tab ([lso2/QuickPane#1](https://github.com/lso2/QuickPane/issues/1)).
- "Delete tab" erased the tab and its pins immediately. It now asks first when the tab has pins, and sends the tab's folder to the Recycle Bin ([lso2/QuickPane#5](https://github.com/lso2/QuickPane/issues/5)).

## [3.10.0] - 2026-09-14

### Added
- Search box at the top of the pane that filters every folder as you type.
- App Folders section, which offers the folder you set for the app whose Save or Open dialog the pane is in.
- "Always start {app} here" on a folder's right-click menu inside a file dialog.
- Recent Apps section listing the applications you have been using, where a row opens its app and its right-click menu offers the folder that app's dialog was last sent to.
- Browser rows in Recent Apps open out into that browser's profiles, where each row opens its own window.
- Setting for which apps Recent Apps lists: the ones you open, the ones whose Save and Open dialogs you use, or both.
- Keyboard shortcut that moves focus into the pane, which stays off until it is turned on under Settings, Hotkeys.
- A This PC row inside the This PC section, which opens This PC and expands to the drives beneath it.
- Files dragged from Explorer onto a pane folder move, copy, or become shortcuts, under the same Ctrl, Shift and Alt rules Explorer uses.
- Settings footer showing the running version and a Download button when a newer release is published.
- Connections tab names both components an SSH mount needs, links each download, and offers the install commands to copy.

### Changed
- Settings are grouped into tabs: Groups, Pane, Hotkeys, Connections and Backup.
- The settings Pane tab is laid out in two columns.
- Search box, App Folders and Recent Apps each have a checkbox and a place in the section order.
- The magnifier sits on the right of the pane's search field, as it does in Explorer's.
- The active profile in settings is marked by a filled Active badge.
- Larger type and more spacing on the Pane, Hotkeys, Connections and Backup tabs.
- Section headers show their expand caret at all times.
- Recent folders open out into their subfolders and line up with every other folder row in the pane.
- Programs carry the name and icon Windows shows for them, which tells side-by-side installs such as Chrome and Chrome Canary apart.
- Deleting a group sends it to the Recycle Bin.
- The mouse wheel scrolls the pane.
- A sideways swipe, a tilt wheel, or Shift with the wheel scrolls the tab strips and the settings profile columns.

### Fixed
- The pane's search box takes the keyboard when it is clicked.
- The search box filters pinned folders and tree rows.
- A heading disappears along with the rows beneath it while a filter is active.

## [3.8.7] - 2026-09-14

### Fixed
- Save and Open dialogs lay out correctly, with the file list, filename box and Save and Cancel buttons in place.
- Save and Open dialogs open faster, with the pane following sooner behind them.
- The pane appears in Save and Open dialogs reliably, including after QuickPane has been running for days.
- Save and Open dialogs keep the size you left them at, instead of growing each time they open.
- The pane is reachable when a dialog opens against the left edge of the screen, and the dialog moves over to make room.
- Ordinary Windows Open and Save dialogs use the pane mode you chose in settings.
- The pane shows up for apps that use the older style of Save dialog, such as IrfanView and Photoshop, sitting against the dialog's left edge.
- Word's Save and Publish dialogs keep their file list and controls visible, with the pane moving to the dialog's left edge.
- Resizing a Save or Open dialog leaves its file list clean, with no leftover pane text painted across the rows.
- The Network section opens Network when you click it.
- Resizing a Save or Open dialog leaves its buttons and bottom row in place, with the pane moving to the dialog's edge.
- Clicking a drive letter in the pane navigates the dialog instead of closing it, and the pane keeps working in that app afterwards.
- Panes sit in the right place and at the right size on a second monitor and on screens at a different scale.
- The group picker opens on the screen you are working on.
- Clicking a folder reaches an Explorer window that is mid-operation.
- QuickPane keeps noticing dialogs and Explorer windows for the whole session.
- Memory use stays steady over a long session.
- The log keeps a month of history without filling up with one repeated line.

## [3.7.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- Crash detection with automatic restart, capped at three restarts in ten minutes.
- Start menu shortcut, an optional desktop shortcut, and a "Create desktop shortcut" tray item.
- Troubleshooting submenu in the tray menu, with "Open log folder" and "Restart QuickPane".
- `events.log`, a journal of crashes, restarts, and dialog problems that accumulates across sessions in `%APPDATA%\QuickPane\Logs`.
- Background thread and unobserved task exceptions are recorded.

### Fixed
- Closing QuickPane from the tray menu counted as a crash.
- Save As navigation could report success when the dialog had not moved.
- Clicking a folder did nothing in a Save or Open dialog that exposes no address bar.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-07-11

### Fixed
- Groups could not be reordered within a profile's own list on the settings page, in either the tray window or the sidebar's embedded copy. Dragging a group's grip picked it up and showed a valid drop cursor, but dropping it back into the same list did nothing, because the drop handler only ever moved a group to a different profile column and silently ignored a same-profile drop. Each group row now accepts the drop itself and reorders in place; moving a group to another profile column is unchanged.

### Changed
- The sidebar's gear button now opens the same Settings window the tray icon opens, instead of sliding a second, cramped copy of the settings UI into the sidebar itself. The compact single-column settings layout introduced in 3.1.0 for that embedded copy is removed along with it, since nothing uses it anymore.

## [3.4.1] - 2026-07-06

### Fixed
- System-wide input lag while navigating. Everything that can touch a slow disk, the network, or cross-process COM now runs on one background worker (`WorkQueue`) instead of the UI thread, which shares Explorer's input queue in Inside mode, so a dead network target or a busy Explorer can no longer freeze input across the desktop while CPU sits idle. This covers shortcut resolution, Shell.Application navigation and path queries, the Windows Recent scan, drive detail queries, existence probes, shell file operations from drops, and slow icon extraction.
- Recent tracking no longer installs a global NAMECHANGE hook. That hook fired for nearly every control text change on the desktop and answered each with a cross-process COM enumeration; activation events plus a slow poll now do the same job for a fraction of the cost.
- The Windows Recent folder is scanned newest-first with a resolution budget, so a Recent folder holding hundreds of shortcuts costs only as much as the visible list.
- Pin, group, and recent rows never probe the disk while building. Existence and file-vs-folder facts come from a background probe cache (`PathStatus`); unknown targets render optimistically and correct themselves moments later, dimming exactly like Explorer does when a share is gone.
- Save/Open dialog panes no longer glitch after the dialog is dragged. A pure move fires a location event per pixel but needs no relayout (controls live in client coordinates), and those events used to trip the relayout back-off and permanently stop pane maintenance for that dialog. Back-off now also resets when the dialog really resizes.
- Dialog detection results are cached per window. Foreground changes and sweep passes no longer re-enumerate the child tree of every open dialog in every app (Photoshop's dialogs were enumerated on every focus change), and an unfamiliar picker is logged once instead of every time it takes focus.
- Every message sent into another app's dialog (navigation text, Enter, OK clicks) uses a timeout, so a host app that is busy saving can never hang QuickPane and, through the shared input queue, the shell.
- Unhandled exceptions are now logged to debug.log and dispatcher exceptions are contained, so crashes are visible and one bad event no longer silently kills the tray app. Missed window-destroy events are swept up, so lost hooks no longer leak panes.
- Group reorders are crash-safe. A reorder interrupted midway (locked folder, antivirus, crash) rolls back instead of stranding groups under temp names, and any temp names left by a hard crash are recovered on the next scan.
- Recents and groups change events always arrive on the UI thread, removing a race between the FileSystemWatcher thread and the pane.
- A navigation no longer rebuilds every section of every open sidebar; each section rebuilds only on its own data, coalesced to one rebuild per change burst.
- Settings saves no longer reload the group store (and its FileSystemWatcher) unless the groups folder actually changed.
- Drag-over highlight sticks no more: rows track the active drop target centrally, so highlight always clears when the drag moves on, drops, or leaves the pane.

### Added
- File pins. Files can be pinned everywhere folders can: drop a file on a group, between pins, or on empty section space, or use the new "Add file..." menu item. File pins open the file on click, offer "Open containing folder", and show the file's own icon; recent files can be pinned directly as file pins.
- Drop-intent menu. Dropping a folder (no modifier) onto a pinned folder now asks: Move into, Copy into, Create shortcut inside, Pin to the group, or Cancel, because a silent default was moving folders people meant to pin. Files keep Explorer's silent semantics (move on same drive, copy across), and modifiers always act silently exactly like Explorer: Ctrl copies, Shift moves, Alt or Ctrl+Shift links.
- Dropping files or folders on empty Groups-section space pins them to the last group (creating a "Pinned" group when none exists), and the drag cursor shows the shortcut arrow wherever a drop will pin rather than move.

### Changed
- Drive details (labels, free space, readiness) load from a cached snapshot and refresh in the background on device changes, so an unreachable mapped drive cannot stall pane rebuilds.
- Expanding a folder row enumerates its children on the worker and fills the subtree when ready, so expanding a slow or dead folder cannot freeze input.

## [3.2.15] - 2026-07-05

### Fixed
- White pane on load and toolbar overlap, fixed with a readiness gate: nothing is shifted and the pane stays hidden until the Explorer window is genuinely presented and its toolbar has laid out, with a five-second fallback for windows that never report one.
- Resize lag, fixed by replacing the perpetual 250 Hz enforcer poll with short bursts triggered only when a window first shows its strip, is activated, or attaches; resizes are held purely by location events with nothing polling against them.
- Two regressions were reverted along the way: hand-driving Measure/Arrange/UpdateLayout on the pane's visual root (corrupted the host's layout pipeline), and `SWP_ASYNCWINDOWPOS` on content-host moves (ignored because the reparent attaches input queues, and it broke the move dedup guards).

## [3.1.1] - 2026-06-01

### Added
- Persistent expand/collapse memory. Section headers, groups, and folder subtrees now remember whether they are open, keyed by section type, group folder, and tree path, so the state survives pane rebuilds, profile switches, window switches, and restarts. State is stored in `uistate.txt` in the QuickPane data folder.
- Horizontal scrolling for the profile tab row, so extra profiles stay reachable instead of clipping, using the same wheel handling as the group tabs.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed
- Critical stability fix. File dialog detection now requires the dialog window class (`#32770`). The Windows desktop (Progman/WorkerW) also hosts a `SHELLDLL_DefView`, so the earlier broad match reparented and resized the desktop, which corrupted explorer.exe and took down every Explorer window at once.
- Empty profile columns accept dropped groups, because the card now has a solid fill and is a valid drop target.
- Group rows in the settings page drag from anywhere on the row rather than only the small grip, and the row's delete button is excluded from the drag.

### Added
- Profile tab row beneath the QuickPane title that switches the shown profile, with a "Show profiles tab row" setting and an "Auto-hide (slide out on hover)" setting that mirrors the desktop dock behavior.
- Compact single-column settings layout for the narrow embedded pane, kept separate from the wide multi-column layout used in the tray settings window.
- Profile columns drawn as cards a step lighter than the panel, each with a clear Activate button and an Active label on the shown profile.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-05-31

### Added
- Profiles. Each profile is an independent workspace with its own groups folder, recents count, and sidebar width, and the active profile's values mirror into the live settings the rest of the app reads.
- Profile switching from the tray icon's right-click menu, with a check on the active profile.
- Multi-column profile management in the settings window, with add, remove, and rename for each profile.
- Dragging a group between profile columns to move it, with Ctrl held to drop a copy so the same group can live in more than one profile.
- Resizable settings window.

### Changed
- A settings file from before profiles migrates automatically into "Profile 1" on first load.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- QuickPane attaches to file Open and Save dialogs and honors the selected pane mode. Inside mode shifts every one of the dialog's controls and widens the dialog so nothing overlaps the pane, and beside mode floats a pane against the dialog's edge.
- Dialog navigation by writing the folder path into the File name box and submitting, working with both the classic dialog and the modern common item dialog.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- The beside-window pane is now an owned window of its Explorer window, so Windows keeps it at that window's z-level, on that window's virtual desktop, and never forces it above other windows. It stays visible when the window loses focus and hides only when the window is minimized or moves to another desktop.

### Added
- Horizontal wheel input scrolls a tab row left and right, while the vertical wheel only ever scrolls the pane.
- All-desktops dock pinning retries after the window has rendered so the pin reliably takes effect.

### Fixed
- Recent reflects folders browsed directly in Explorer, captured through window activation, title changes, and a light periodic check, with a location-URL fallback when the shell folder object returns nothing.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added
- Native file drag operations. Dragging files from Explorer onto a folder moves on the same drive and copies across drives, with Ctrl to copy, Shift to move, and Alt to create a shortcut, using the shell so progress, conflicts, and undo behave normally.
- Title header with the QuickPane logo and a chevron that collapses or expands the pane in the window modes and toggles auto-hide on the desktop dock.

### Changed
- Helper windows and the dock are tool windows, so QuickPane no longer appears as a blank entry in Alt+Tab.
- The support button reads "Buy me a coffee".

## [2.1.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added
- Optional desktop dock at the left screen edge, registered as an AppBar and independent of the window pane.
- Dock auto-hide that collapses to a thin strip and slides out on hover.
- Setting to show the dock on every virtual desktop.
- Dock clicks navigate the active Explorer window and bring it forward, or open a new window when none is open.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Beside-window mode that floats a follower pane at the left of each Explorer window without shifting its content, alongside the original inside mode that reparents the pane.
- Off mode for dock-only use.
- Pane mode selector in settings.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added
- Network and Linux (WSL) as their own sections, each with a visibility checkbox and a proper icon.
- Expandable drives under This PC and expandable folder subtrees throughout, enumerated lazily like the native Explorer tree.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-15

### Added
- Group, tab, and pin management with create, rename, and delete.
- Drag to reorder groups, tabs, and pins with a visible drop line, plus a semi-transparent placeholder when reordering tabs.
- Dragging a group onto another merges its tabs, and dragging a tab to empty space makes it a new group.
- A seeded default group on first run so the pane is never empty.

### Changed
- All text entry goes through top-level prompt windows, because the embedded pane cannot take keyboard focus.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added
- First usable version. A sidebar that reparents into each Explorer window and shifts the window's content to make room.
- Pinned folder groups with horizontally scrollable tabs, where a single-tab group renders like a plain group.
- This PC and Recent sections.
- Settings panel, tray icon, and a "Pin to Quick Pane" folder context-menu verb.
- One-click Inno Setup installer that runs without administrator rights.

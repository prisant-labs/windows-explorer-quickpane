# Tries a development build on your own desktop, then puts the installed copy back.
#
# Only one copy of QuickPane runs at a time, so a development build has to replace the installed copy
# while it runs. This script does the four manual steps in docs/DEVELOPMENT.md in order:
#   1. Builds QuickPane.exe, unless -NoBuild is given.
#   2. Backs up %APPDATA%\QuickPane, because a development build reads and writes the same settings.
#   3. Closes whatever copy is running with --exit, and starts the development build.
#   4. Waits until the development build has exited, then starts the installed copy again if it was
#      running before. Starting it also points the Start menu shortcut back at it.
#
# Close the development build from its tray icon when you are done. It never kills a copy: a kill skips
# the layout restore, and the watchdog would restart the app. The watchdog also relaunches a crashed
# build, so the script waits until no copy from the build folder has run for a few seconds.
#
# If the script is interrupted, run it again with -RestoreInstalled to close the development build and
# start the installed copy.
#
# This script acts on the copy running on your desktop. It is for people, not for coding agents.
# It runs under Windows PowerShell 5.1 or PowerShell 7.
#
# Usage:  pwsh -File scripts/dev-run.ps1 [-Configuration Release|Debug] [-NoBuild] [-Exe <path>]
#         pwsh -File scripts/dev-run.ps1 -RestoreInstalled
